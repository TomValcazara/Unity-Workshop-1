# 🎮 Unity Data Logging & GitHub Workshop

## 🧩 About This Project  
In this workshop, I explored how to use **Unity packages** and how to integrate **GitHub** into my workflow.  
I also tested a **custom ExtralityLab package** that logs data to external files, something really useful for **user testing** and **research**.  

## ⚙️ What I Did  
- Created a new Unity project and connected it to my GitHub repo.  
- Imported the **ExtralityLab Data Logger** package and ran the sample scene to see how event tracking works.  
- Started outlining ideas for my **individual project** using the **Project Design Document (PDD)**.  

## 📦 Deliverables  
- My preliminary **Project Design Document**.  
- The **public GitHub repository** where my project will be developed.
